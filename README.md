# Zef-Android 
This project is a fork from an original project called Zef.

Zef (https://github.com/ethereon/Zef) is a computer vision library based on the Haskell language, providing demo code for the iOS platform.

After forking the project, I renamed it to Zef-Android with the intention of adding a demo for the Android platform.

# Introduction 
Zef-Android is an extension of the Zef project, specifically tailored for Android developers who want to explore computer vision capabilities within their Android applications. By leveraging Zef's core functionalities and adapting them to the Android ecosystem, developers can easily integrate powerful computer vision features into their mobile apps.

# Features
Cross-platform computer vision algorithms
Optimized for Android performance
Easy integration with Android projects
Demo showcasing various computer vision tasks on Android devices

# Usage 
Clone the Zef-Android repository:

```
# bash
# Copy code
# git clone https://github.com/your_username/Zef-Android.git
# Follow the instructions in the README of the Zef-Android repository to set up and run the Android demo.
```
# Contribution
Contributions to Zef-Android are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements, bug fixes, or new features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on the GitHub repository.
